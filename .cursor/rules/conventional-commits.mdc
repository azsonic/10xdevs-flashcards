# Conventional Commits

All commits in this project MUST follow the [Conventional Commits v1.0.0](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification.

## Commit Message Format

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

## Types

Use one of the following types for each commit:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `feat` | A new feature (correlates with MINOR in SemVer) |
| `fix` | A bug fix (correlates with PATCH in SemVer) |
| `docs` | Documentation only changes |
| `style` | Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, etc.) |
| `refactor` | A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature |
| `perf` | A code change that improves performance |
| `test` | Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests |
| `build` | Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies |
| `ci` | Changes to CI configuration files and scripts |
| `chore` | Other changes that don't modify src or test files |

## Rules

1. **Type is required** - Every commit must start with a type
2. **Description is required** - A short summary must follow the type
3. **Use lowercase** - Type and description should be lowercase
4. **No period at end** - Don't end the description with a period
5. **Use imperative mood** - Write as a command: "add feature" not "added feature"
6. **Scope is optional** - Use parentheses for scope: `feat(auth): add login`
7. **Breaking changes** - Use `!` after type/scope or add `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer

## Examples

### Simple commit
```
feat: add user authentication
```

### Commit with scope
```
fix(api): handle null response from server
```

### Breaking change
```
feat(api)!: change authentication flow

BREAKING CHANGE: JWT tokens now expire after 1 hour instead of 24 hours
```

### Commit with body
```
fix: prevent race condition in data fetching

Introduce a request id and reference to latest request.
Dismiss incoming responses other than from latest request.
```

### Documentation change
```
docs: update API documentation for auth endpoints
```

## When Generating Commit Messages

When asked to create or suggest a commit message:
1. Analyze the changes made
2. Determine the appropriate type based on the nature of changes
3. Identify a scope if changes are localized to a specific area
4. Write a clear, concise description in imperative mood
5. Add a body if additional context is needed
6. Include `BREAKING CHANGE` footer if applicable
